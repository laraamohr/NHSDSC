### Project Log

2023/12/22

Wrote a polynomial regression model for the dataset. Results not entirely accurate. Mostly due to model not fitting well because of non-linear/non-polynomial nature of dataset. Moving on to trying logistic regression model.

Just saw mention of a technique termed **multinomial classification**. Worth looking into as it might be relevant for our project. Will try to pursue this model if logistic regression does not work as planned.

**KEY NOTE: As of right now all code is using the "diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv" dataset. Other two datasets yet to be investigated and implemented.**
